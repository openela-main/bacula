======== Quick start

Please look at the following files for a quick start with the various database
backends:

- quickstart_mysql.txt
- quickstart_postgresql.txt
- quickstart_sqlite3.txt

======== PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite databases

Bacula director supports different databases backends, if you want to switch
away from the default PostgreSQL one you need to change the "libbaccats" (the
catalogue library) symlink to the real library.

To change to a different backend, issue the following command:

# alternatives --config libbaccats.so

There are 3 programs which provide 'libbaccats.so'.

  Selection    Command
-----------------------------------------------
   1           /usr/lib64/libbaccats-mysql.so
   2           /usr/lib64/libbaccats-sqlite3.so
*+ 3           /usr/lib64/libbaccats-postgresql.so

Enter to keep the current selection[+], or type selection number: 1

There is NO need to edit any part in the Bacula Director configuration; for the
purposes of the database creation steps, the bacula-dir.conf configuration file
can be left at their default values.

======== Switiching between PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite backends

To switch the configured backend to another one, follow the above procedure.
Again, there's no need to edit the Bacula Director configuration file; the
catalog resource can be left as is.

Importing and exporting data between the various database formats is up to the
user. If the database will be re-initialized from scratch, follow the quick
start guides mentioned above.

======== Upgrading from old Redhat releases

When upgrading from old Redhat releases, the "bacula-libs-sql" package takes
care of making the appropriate selection for the database backend based on what
was previously configured on the old system.

The default permissions in the "/etc/bacula" folder have changed; please perform
the following commands for restoring the permissions for the correct operation
of the daemons.

# chown -R root:root /etc/bacula
# chmod 755 /etc/bacula
# chmod 640 /etc/bacula/*
# chgrp bacula /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf /etc/bacula/query.sql

All the files that are part of the Director configuration (included with @) must
of course have the same permissions as the main configuration file.

======== Documentation

To see all the available documentation in both HTML and PDF formats, please
install the "bacula-docs" package.

======== Granting user access to the console

The console configuration files are normally readable only by root for security
reasons. If you need to grant access to a specific user or group of users to
the consoles, you can adjust the ACLs on the configuration files. For example:

# setfacl -m u:user:r /etc/bacula/bconsole.conf /etc/bacula/bat.conf

This way the user 'user' can open the console without superuser privileges.
